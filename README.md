# CNN_SMS_Classification

This code demonstrates the process of building an SMS message classification model using a CNN architecture in Keras. It showcases various steps such as data preprocessing, tokenization, sequence padding, handling class imbalance, and model training. The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Jaccard score.
